## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

This was my project working with the DOM and interactivity with javascript. It was fun and challenging as I had to do a lot of google searches and watched some youtube tutorial videos.
My greatest challenge though was how to change the homepage contents into the 'thank you' state on clicking submit.
I finally went on to do :
```css
{
  display: none
}
```
to hide elements when clicking the submit button

### Continued development

I would love to learn more about working with the DOM because I see how powerful It can be combining it with JavaScript. Hopeful to build more projects
